#+TITLE: Divvun spelling and grammar checker plugin for WoodWing ContentStation 10

This is a plugin for WoodWing ContentStation 10 that provides spelling
and grammar checking with Divvun's proofing tools (see
http://divvun.no/ and https://github.com/divvun/divvun-gramcheck).

Currently, we just do "batch" spelling. That is, after writing a text,
you can open the plugin and let it check the text and show spelling
suggestions in a separate window, you may then pick suggestions and
apply them back to the original document.

* Limitations
There is no on-the-fly spelling, only batch. The WoodWing API doesn't
yet provide a way to underline and put events on strings in their
editor. When such an API arrives, we should be able to do spelling
on-the-fly.

There is also no support yet for the digital editor (multichannel),
only the print editor, since WoodWing doesn't yet provide an API for
the digital editor. The API is expected to come some time in the first
quarter of 2018.

* Installing
** Frontend (this repo)

To install the frontend, put the contents of the =release= folder into
a subdirectory named =divvungc= of the WoodWing =config/plugins=
folder on the server. If this folder is e.g.

=/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/Enterprise/config/plugins/divvungc/=

then you can copy it from your machine with

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
rsync -avh release/ woodwingserver:/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/Enterprise/config/plugins/divvungc/
# The trailing / here is important
#+END_SRC


Then add these lines to the =plugins= object of
=/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/Enterprise/contentstation/config.js=:

#+BEGIN_SRC js
     printEditor: [
       '../config/plugins/divvungc/bundle.js'
     ]
#+END_SRC

making it e.g.
#+BEGIN_SRC js
   plugins: {
     contentStation: [
     ],
     printEditor: [
       '../config/plugins/divvungc/bundle.js'
     ]
   }
#+END_SRC

** Backend
URL to the backend is currently hardcoded in the JavaScript. If you
need to change the URL/port/subdir, you can edit [[file:release/bundle.js::this.hostname%20%3D%20"192.168.22.60"%3B][release/bundle.js]] and
change the lines

#+BEGIN_SRC js
    this.hostname = "192.168.22.60";
    this.port = "2737";
    this.protocol = window.location.protocol;
    this.subdir = "";
#+END_SRC

If you wish to run the backend from your own server, see the file
[[file:scripts/avvir-build-backend][scripts/avvir-build-backend]] for build instructions. This is currently
a bit complicated, we hope to make it easier in the future.

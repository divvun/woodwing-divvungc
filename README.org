#+TITLE: Divvun spelling and grammar checker plugin for WoodWing ContentStation 10

This is a plugin for WoodWing ContentStation 10 that provides spelling
and grammar checking with Divvun's proofing tools (see
http://divvun.no/ and https://github.com/divvun/divvun-gramcheck).

Currently, we just do "batch" spelling. That is, after writing a text,
you can open the plugin and let it check the text and show spelling
suggestions in a separate window, you may then pick suggestions and
apply them back to the original document.

The WoodWing API doesn't yet provide a way to underline and put events
on strings in their editor; when they do, we might be able to do
spelling on-the-fly.

* Installing

To use, put the contents of the =release= folder into the folder

=/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/Enterprise/config/plugins/divvungc/=

on the server; e.g.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
rsync -avh release/ woodwingserver:/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/Enterprise/config/plugins/divvungc/
# The trailing / here is important
#+END_SRC


Then add these lines to the =plugins= object of
=/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/Enterprise/contentstation/config.js=:

#+BEGIN_SRC js
     printEditor: [
       '../../config/plugins/divvungc/bundle.js'
     ]
#+END_SRC

making it e.g.
#+BEGIN_SRC js
   plugins: {
     contentStation: [
     ],
     printEditor: [
       '../../config/plugins/divvungc/bundle.js'
     ]
   }
#+END_SRC
